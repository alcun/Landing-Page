Landing page project for a business using HTML and CSS


It demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS with elements such as header, header-img, nav-bar, nav-link, embedded video, forms and submission, media query and CSS flexboxes.

Tested with JS under freecodecamp.org parameters.
(For some reason it won't detect @media on here but it worked on project submission)
